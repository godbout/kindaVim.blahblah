# The Site

[kindavim.app](https://kindavim.app) for all the fancy stuff.

# The License

Without a coffee a month kindaVim sleeps in the mornings. (It will scold you from the Menu Bar when you'll try to use it.)
You're still able to use it fully-featured the afternoons. (Until 5am the next day. Those are long afternoons, yes.)
So if you're like me and spend your mornings reading, swimming in the open sea or climbing rocks, then kV is basically free.

# The Docs

The Docs have been moved [here](https://docs.kindavim.app). Updates ongoing!

# The AccessibilityStrategyTestApp

Testing the Vim moves when using the macOS Accessibility requires building an external app. This app, as well as the tests of each move in the context of the Accessibility Strategy, are open source and available here: [AccessibilityStrategyTestApp](https://github.com/godbout/AccessibilityStrategyTestApp)
